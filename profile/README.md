IdentityBlockchain is based on using state certified electronic identities (eIDs) to establish blockchain identities, and a concensus protocol called Proof of Identity (POI).
POI is extremaly ”green”, and enables a lot of applications which are impossible without verified identity on the blockchain, e.g. direct democracy and universal basic income. POI as here presented also tries not to sacrifice anonimity of identity.
