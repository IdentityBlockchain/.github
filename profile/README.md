IdentityBlockchain uses state-certified electronic identities (eIDs) to establish blockchain identities and a consensus protocol called Proof of Identity (POI).

POI is ”green” and enables many applications that are impossible to implement without verified identity on the blockchain, e.g., direct democracy and universal basic income, encrypted messaging, etc.

IdentityBlockchain, as presented here, aims to preserve the anonymity of identity by using zk-SNARKs and an anonymizing protocol for identity onboarding.
