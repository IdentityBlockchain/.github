IdentityBlockchain is based on using state-certified electronic identities (eIDs) to establish blockchain identities, and a consensus protocol called Proof of Identity (POI).

POI is extremely ”green” and enables a lot of applications that are impossible without verified identity on the blockchain, e.g. direct democracy and universal basic income, encrypted messaging, etc.

IdentityBlockchain as here presented has the goal to preserve the anonymity of identity by using zk-SNARKs and an anonymizing protocol for identity onboarding.
