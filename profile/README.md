IdentityBlockchain is based on using state certified electronic identities (eIDs) to establish blockchain identities, and a concensus protocol called Proof of Identity (POI).

POI is extremaly ”green”, and enables a lot of applications which are impossible without verified identity on the blockchain, e.g. direct democracy and universal basic income, encrypted messaging etc. 

IdentityBlockchain as here presented has the goal to preserve the anonymity of identity by using zk-SNARKs and an anonymizing protocol for identity onboarding.
